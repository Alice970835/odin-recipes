    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon Pepper Baked Cod is a dish that combines the mild and flaky texture of cod with the zesty brightness of lemon and the bold flavors of black pepper. It's a simple yet elegant recipe that's perfect for a light and healthy dinner. Whether you're a seafood lover or just looking for a quick and delicious meal, this recipe is a must-try. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a baking dish or line it with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the juice of one lemon, olive oil, minced garlic, lemon pepper seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create the marinade. Place the cod fillets in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle the lemon marinade over the cod fillets, ensuring they are well coated. Place lemon slices from the second lemon on top of the fillets for an extra burst of flavor. Bake the cod in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and has an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). Once baked, remove the cod from the oven. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired, for a pop of color and freshness. Serve your Lemon Pepper Baked Cod hot with your choice of sides, such as steamed vegetables, a fresh salad, or a bed of fluffy rice. Lemon pepper seasoning can be adjusted to your taste.</p>
