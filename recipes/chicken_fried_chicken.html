    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Southern dish is made by lightly breading boneless pieces of chicken in a flour-and-cracker mixture, then frying it in a shallow pool of oil. Like chicken-fried steak, the effect is a crispy meat that is sure to be enjoyed by the whole family, and it's often served smothered under white gravy atop a pile of mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h2>What you will need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken breasts:</strong> You can buy cutlets instead, or follow our directions and flatten breasts for faster frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and pepper:</strong>To season the breading mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Saltine crackers:</strong>These will be crushed and mixed with flour for the breading.</li>
        <li><strong>All-purpose flour:</strong>Classic chicken breading.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong>This will help the breading puff up during frying for extra crispy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Red pepper:</strong>Season the breading with your favorite spices, but we like a little heat from pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>You'll use this to make the wet dip for the chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong>You'll use 4 in this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanut oil:</strong>For frying. We like the neutral flavor and the high smoke point of this oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1. Pound chicken: </strong>Place each piece of chicken between two pieces of plastic wrap and flat to 1/4-inch thick with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2. Make breading:</strong>Combine the cracker crumbs, flour, baking powder, salt, and both peppers in a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3. Make egg mixture:</strong>In another shallow bowl, combine some of the milk and the eggs. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4. Dredge the chicken:</strong>Dip each chicken piece first in the cracker crumb mixture, then the milk mixture, then again back into the cracker crumb mixture. Repeat for each piece of chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5. Fry: </strong>Slowly lower each piece of breaded chicken into a skillet with heated oil, and fry in batches until the chicken crust is golden brown. This should take about 15 minutes total, and you should flip the chicken after about 10 minutes. Remove the fried chicken to a cooling rack that's sitting in a baking sheet. Hold in a warm oven until all the chicken is fried.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6. Make gravy:</strong>Take some of the drippings from the frying oil. Whisk together the remaining flour, salt, pepper, and milk. Add the reserved drippings to a skillet, and add the flour-milk mixture. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes or until thickened. Serve gravy over chicken.</li>
    </ul>
